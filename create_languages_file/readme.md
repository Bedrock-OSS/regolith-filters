# Create Languages File

This filter creates the file `languages.json`, based on the current `.lang` files found in your project. 

You can learn more about this [file here](), and see an example [here](https://github.com/bedrock-dot-dev/packs/blob/master/stable/resource/texts/languages.json).

Its not a particularly difficult file to create, but maybe it saves you a few clicks now and then!
