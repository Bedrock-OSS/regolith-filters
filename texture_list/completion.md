# texture_list

This filter automatically creates `texture_list.json` for you, so you don't need to! To learn more about this file, you can read our [wiki article](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/visuals/textures-list.html#top).

In a nutshell, this file makes Minecraft more efficient, by caching where textures are located. In some versions of Minecraft, failing to create this file actually results in a content log. Letting Regolith generate this file for you is the easiest way to ensure MC stays fast, and content-log-free.

This filter also supports subpacks.
