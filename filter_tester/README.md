# What does this filter do?
This filter is meant to be used by the filter developers to test other filters.
It compares the expected results with the files generated by Regolith. The
result files are stored in `data/filter_tester/RP` and `data/filter_tester/BP`.

# How to use it?
Copy this code to the botom of the filter list in the config file of your
test project of your filter.
```
                    {
                        "filter": "filter_tester",
                        "settings": {
                          "errors_stop_execution": false
                        }
                    },
```
Put the expected results in `data/filter_tester/RP` and
`data/filter_tester/BP` folders for your resource pack and behavior
pack respectively.

The filter will print messages about the differences between the expected
and the actual results. You can use `errors_stop_execution` setting to make
`filter_tester` stop Regolith if any differences are found.

## Configuration settings
- `errors_stop_execution: bool` - If true, the filter will stop Regolith with
  sys.exit(1) in case of finding any errors. If false, the filter will just
  print the errors and continue. The default value is false.
